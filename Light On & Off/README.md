# Bulb on and Off

This project consists of a simple HTML file and associated JavaScript and CSS files to create a basic web page that allows users to control the state of a light bulb image with accompanying sound effects.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file, which provides the structure and content of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the functionality of turning the light bulb on and off.

## Getting Started

1. Download or clone this project to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the web page.

3. Click the "ON" button to turn on the light bulb. This action will change the image and play an associated sound effect.

4. Click the "OFF" button to turn off the light bulb. This action will revert the image and play another sound effect.

## Project Files

### index.html

The main HTML file provides the structure and content of the web page. It includes the light bulb image, buttons for turning the light bulb on and off, and an audio element for playing sound effects.

### style.css

The `style.css` file contains the styles and layout rules for the web page. It links to an external stylesheet, `style.css`, which is not provided in this project. You can create your own or link to an existing CSS file to style the page.

### script.js

The `script.js` file includes the JavaScript functions that handle the functionality of turning the light bulb on and off. It dynamically changes the image source and plays audio when the corresponding buttons are clicked.

## Usage

The project demonstrates a basic interaction on a web page, allowing users to control the state of a light bulb with accompanying sound effects. You can use this as a starting point for more complex web applications or educational purposes.
